# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of Project
The initial project was to create an interactive map that displayed earthquake activities around the world during the past seven days. The purpose of this project is to add tectonic plates’ location to the earthquake data and add earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 

## Results
Maps were created to toggle between three different base layers: street, satellite, and dark view. The interactive maps also toggled through three types of information: earthquakes location plus magnitude, tectonic plates’ location, and earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.

The three map styles are illustrated below:
